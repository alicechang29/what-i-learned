## Conceptual Questions 
Say you are trying to connect to a server on another host (another "machine", real or virtual), and it fails.  Imagine 2 different scenarios:

A) The connection fails immediately, with an error message that includes the words "connection refused"

B) The connection fails after more than 30 seconds, maybe a minute, and the error message says something else (i.e. whatever the error says, it does not include "connection refused").

From only that information, what can you conclude about why you can't connect to the server in each scenario?  (The 2 scenarios point to different things being wrong on the server end)

Assume there is no firewall or any other relevant network equipment in between.
