- Think of at least one example of some kind of API request over HTTP which would count as "not REST"   
    
- If someone described an API as saying it is purely a JSON REST API, and provided a list of entity names like users, schools, etc, and for each resource listed all the fields including their types and which were required, would you need to know anything else?

- What is the difference between PUT and PATCH?  What are the downsides/failure cases to watch out for when using each one?
