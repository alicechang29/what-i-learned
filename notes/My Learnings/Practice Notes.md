More confident on code syntax.
Don't run the code. If not sure, be confident and just move on.
"availble" string. When there are two options, just use a boolean. 3 options -> enum.
Consistent styling: spaces.
One of the reference principles: bigger entities hold ref to smaller entities.
Use unique id more.
Throw exception whenver possible; fail fast.
Utilize unique id for faster queries whenever possible.
Good complexity analysis.

Really good explanation as you proceed through the code.
Fail fast: it's more like edge case optimization. Not needed usually.
