- Solo day for SIS 
	- Had a relatively simple ticket which was to update the UI 
	- spent 8 hours trying to figure out how to write tests 
	- thought I was being clever by using a factory that could generate all my instances 
	- later found out the factory should only be used to generate fake db 
- Found a missing relationship between 2 entities 
	- Confirmed with VP that there is a missing relation 
	- Made enhancement to the schema so that they would be connected
		- lookup_type.id 
	- Now there is access between relationship with 
		- table of relationships 
			- student 
			- parent 
		- applicant users 
	- **Find the impact**
